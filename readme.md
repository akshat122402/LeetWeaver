# LeetWeaver ðŸ¤–

LeetWeaver is an experimental AI-powered system designed to automatically solve LeetCode programming problems. It utilizes a multi-agent architecture, leveraging Google's Gemini language models to understand problem descriptions, devise plans, write code, generate tests, debug errors, and interact with the LeetCode website.

## Overview

The goal of LeetWeaver is to simulate a programmer's workflow when tackling a LeetCode problem:

1.  **Analyze:** Understand the problem statement and constraints.
2.  **Plan:** Devise a high-level algorithm or approach.
3.  **Code:** Implement the solution in Python.
4.  **Test:** Run the code against example and generated test cases locally.
5.  **Debug:** If tests fail or submission is rejected, analyze the errors and attempt to fix the code.
6.  **Submit:** Submit the code to LeetCode and check the result.

## Features

*   **Multi-Agent System:** Different agents specialize in specific tasks (planning, coding, testing, debugging).
*   **LLM Integration:** Uses the Gemini API (via `google-genai`) for natural language understanding, code generation, and analysis.
*   **LeetCode Interaction:** Uses Selenium (`undetected-chromedriver`) to log in, fetch problem details, input code, and submit solutions.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Employs a loop where code is tested and debugged iteratively until it passes or reaches a maximum iteration limit.

## Architecture

The system is orchestrated by the `Orchestrator` (`core/orchestrator.py`), which manages the flow between different agents:

*   **`ProblemAnalyzerAgent`:** Analyzes the description, identifies constraints, and creates a plan.
*   **`CodingAgent`:** Generates Python code based on the plan, description, and previous attempts/debug info.
*   **`TestingAgent`:** Extracts/generates test cases and runs the code locally using `utils/execution.py`.
*   **`DebuggingAgent`:** Analyzes failed test results or submission errors and asks the LLM for fixes.

Core components:
*   **`LeetCodeInterface`:** Handles Selenium-based web interactions.
*   **`WorkflowState`:** A dataclass holding the state passed between agents.
*   **`llm_api`:** Centralized utility for interacting with the Gemini API.
*   **`execution`:** Utility for running Python code (currently insecure).

## Setup

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Google Chrome or Chromium browser installed (for Selenium/`undetected-chromedriver`)

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetweaver.git # Replace with your repo URL if applicable
    cd leetweaver
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy the `.env.example` file (if provided) or create a new file named `.env` in the project root.
    *   Add your credentials and API key:
        ```dotenv:.env
        # LeetCode Credentials
        LEETCODE_USERNAME="your_leetcode_username"
        LEETCODE_PASSWORD="your_leetcode_password"

        # Gemini API Key (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
        GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"

        # Optional: Gemini Configuration
        GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-1.5-pro-latest" # Or another suitable model like gemini-1.5-flash-latest
        GEMINI_RPM=60 # Rate limit (requests per minute for the API)

        # Optional: Orchestrator Configuration
        MAX_ITERATIONS=5 # Max attempts per problem
        ```
    *   **Important:** Ensure your LeetCode account does **not** have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled, as the current Selenium script cannot handle it. Consider using a dedicated account for testing if necessary.

## Usage

Run the main script from the project root directory, providing the URL of the LeetCode problem you want to solve:

```bash
python main.py "https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/"
```

Replace the URL with the desired problem URL. The script will log the process, including agent actions, LLM interactions (prompts/responses can be enabled via logging level), test results, and submission status.
